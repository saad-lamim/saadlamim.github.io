## Projects
<br>
### Design and Analysis of a Circular Patch Antenna  
A patch antenna was designed and simulated in Ansys. The analysis included return loss, antenna gain at different frequencies, and radiation pattern visualization.

---

### Human Follower Shopping Cart  
A simple shopping cart that can detect objects and has controlled forward and backward movement with speed control. Pixycam was used for vision.

---

### VOIS: Video Over Intercom System  
A low-cost, AI-powered video intercom system integrating voice communication, live video streaming, face recognition, smart door lock control, and emergency SOS functionalities.

---

### Implementation of a Mobile Phone Using STM32F446RE Microcontroller  
This project demonstrated the use of the STM32 microcontroller, where a mobile phone was built using the controller as the processor to send and receive texts and calls.

---

### Intelligent Traffic Control System  
Modeled the complex traffic of a four-way junction using LEDs and ModelSIM-Altera board. The system was automated using a state-machine algorithm to control traffic.

---

### AC Signal Modifier  
A Graphical User Interface (GUI) that can take any kind of input signal and clip, clamp, or regulate it. It also shows the required circuit diagram and the output signal.

---

### Electricity Bill Reduction of a Garments Factory by Proper Correction of Power Factor  
Modeled the electrical loads to continuously monitor the power factor. An appropriate capacitor was selected for correction to reduce electricity bills.

---

### A Three-Level Boost Converter  
Developed a three-level boost converter that delivers higher voltage conversion efficiency, lower inductor current ripples, output voltage ripples, and reduced voltage stresses on switches compared to conventional boost converters.

---

### Transient Stability Analysis of a Power System  
Simulated a multi-machine system to demonstrate the features and scope of a Simulink-based model for transient stability analysis. An integral model was illustrated with complete details and practical solutions for obtaining stability.

---

### Complete Electrical Service Design of a Building  
Designed a complete electrical service from power supply to end-point devices. Prepared different ground, floor, and roof plans with exact power ratings using AutoCAD.

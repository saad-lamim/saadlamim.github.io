<p>
I am a BUET trained electrical engineer with a strong academic background in communication and signal processing. My research interests lie in next-generation wireless communication technologies, particularly 5G and 6G systems.

During my undergraduate studies, I gained extensive experience in wireless, radar, satellite and microwave communications. Under the supervision of Dr. Md. Forkan Uddin, I investigated pilot allocation and power control optimization for cell-free massive MIMO, focusing on minimizing channel estimation error. I am proficient in MATLAB, C and Python; and actively apply these skills to solve complex problems in wireless communication systems.

I am interested in pursuing higher studies in wireless communication systems where I intend to explore network architecture, NFV, SDN, network slicing and novel air interfaces. My objective is to advance the development of next-generation wireless networks through rigorous research and innovation.

I am a BUET trained electrical engineer with a strong academic background in communication and signal processing. My research interests lie in next-generation wireless communication technologies, particularly 5G and 6G systems.

During my undergraduate studies, I gained extensive experience in digital signal processing, wireless, radar and microwave communications. Under the supervision of Dr. Md. Forkan Uddin, I investigated pilot allocation and power control optimization for cell-free massive MIMO, focusing on minimizing channel estimation error. I am proficient in coding and optimization tools like MATLAB, Python and AMPL; and actively apply these skills to solve complex problems in wireless communication systems.

I am seeking research opportunities in wireless communication and related systems to explore enabling technologies and applications of next-generation networks, with the goal of advancing communication protocols through rigorous research and innovation.

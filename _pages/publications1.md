## [Joint Pilot Assignment and Pilot Power Allocation to Minimize Channel Estimation Error in Cell-free Massive MIMO Communications](/files/research_paper.pdf)

_Submitted in [IEEE ICTP 2025](htttps://https://ieee-ictp.buet.ac.bd/) Conference_ 

In cell free massive MIMO communications, optimal
pilot assignment for reducing pilot contamination and normalized
mean square error (NMSE) of channel estimation significantly
depends on the pilot power allocation. However, most of the
existing studies focus on the pilot assignment and pilot power
allocation problem separately, which cannot provide the optimal
performance. This study proposes joint pilot assignment and
pilot power allocation to minimize the maximum NMSE of
channel estimation in cell free massive MIMO communications.
We consider a large number of access points (APs) to serve a
much smaller number of users in TDD operation, where APs are
grouped using a large scale fading based AP selection scheme
for individual user. We formulate an optimization problem to
minimize the maximum NMSE of channel estimation between
the APs and users via joint pilot assignment and pilot power
allocation. The problem is found to be non-convex mixed-integer
nonlinear programming (MINLP). We solve the problem for
several scenarios using the Knitro optimization tool with a low
tolerance level. Our results show that the proposed joint scheme
yields the lowest NMSE in channel estimation compared to
systems that use full-power for pilot signal transmission or those
where pilot assignment and pilot power allocation are performed
separately.
